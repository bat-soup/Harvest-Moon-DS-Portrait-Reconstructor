# Harvest-Moon-DS-Portrait-Reconstructor
Program that takes the resulting folder of my face.bin parser and reconstructs all the graphics into their viewable state.


***HOW TO USE***

This should be used in tandem with my face.bin parser. face.bin Parser's resulting output folder should be all you need for this program to work properly.

reconstruct_FINAL.py -- you do not need to make any changes
walk_reconstruct.py -- simply edit the first filepath to point to the output folder resulted from face.bin. the directory should be pointing to the spot that contains all the folders that are numbered.

Enjoy!
